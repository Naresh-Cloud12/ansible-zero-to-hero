Day 1: Introduction to Ansible and Getting Started

- Overview of Ansible: What is Ansible, its advantages, and why use it?
- Comparison with Shell and Python scripting for automation.
- Installing Ansible on different platforms.
- IDE(VS Code) and Plugin configuration.

- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c5dc1b3-9c43-43a5-8ab8-c87218f24ffd)
Ansible is a automation platform  where it can help for provisioning,configuration,deployment(CI/CD) & Network Automation.
in terms of provisioning creating infrastructure,creating ec2 instances,creating platform,interms of configuration it can help for life of devops engineer or sys admin by managing configuration 100's of vm.it can usefull for deployment phase and network automations.

Day 2: Ansible Adhoc Commands

- Passwordless Authentication
- Ansible Inventory 
- Understanding Adhoc commands and their usage.
- Examples of common Adhoc commands for system management tasks.
- Exploring the power of Adhoc commands for quick tasks.

  If a devops want to install ngnix for multiple machine through YML / Adhoc commands in control Node it will instruct that to manage nodes also it will be blocked bcz of authentication so need to know Password or SSH Keys.That is what mentioned in Diagram,,,,![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e747a63-cfed-4075-9bb2-25d4888f0b64)

Instead we setup passwordless authentication between ansible control node and manage node it will execute the instruction but we need passwordless authentication should be there so what it is ---It is a mechanisim where u tell the vm for eg a and b. Using the passwordless authenction to B anytime if u getting any instruction VM from A do not ask access for A allow the Access If it tried to coneect give access. For that we have to Initially only for the first we need to provide the password or PEM File from next time it wonts ask password like that.Anyone can connect. So the core ways is the command 
ssh -copy -id there are two ways 1 by password and ssh key for the first time.whatever the organization is used.

Because in some organizaation block passwordelss authentication

Lets create 2 Ec2 Instance and different type of approach one is ssh and password

Step 1 - ssh way--

ssh-copy-id -f "-o IdentityFile <PATH TO PEM FILE>" ubuntu@<INSTANCE-PUBLIC-IP> command for terminal and fill the pem files and instance ip address and click yes and exectute the command whatever it mentioned  so Now connected after that use this command SSH -ubuntu @IPAddress now it will connected to from our laptop to the EC2 Instances... SO thi ssh key

Step 2 -- Password way

Go to the 2nd instances created and connect to ssh -i <Path of the keypair> Ubantu@IPAddreess then yes now enter sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/60-cloudimg-settings.conf just say Yes in password authentication.. so in any organization if they are not using EC2 instance so we can give command 
sudo vim  /etc/ssh/ and in that u can able to sshd_Config then enter with  sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config in this file u will field called password authectication commented so go and uncommnet that then we need to restart that using sudo systemctl restart ssh so we need to give password for cnnect using sudp passwd ubuntu enter password now log out
Then ssh-copy-id Ubuntu @IPAddress then we need to enter the password and again ssh ubuntu @IPADrress now connected 

With these we have benifis to runn any script using YAML OR Adhoc commands of having ansible we can able to install or whatever for manage nodes also

How ansible know these will be my control nodes so there is a way that's called ansible Inventory actually its  a file we need to provide a filed we need to puth the User and the ipaddress.

INvertory is heart of the Ansible---Because it will tell ur ansible control node to which servers it has to talk that is what are ur ansible manage nodes.What is the externsion of invertory it can either write in Yaml format or .Ini extension or invertory.ini whatever the extensionshould .ini(dot.ini)
If you dont want to provide invertory file everytime go to the file called /etc/ansible/hosts if its not there create and store the server if you dont provide any ini file that will take automaticallly....So what is the recommended approach YAML?INI 

eg. vim Invertory.ini
--- ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping all ---so all- the server in the invertory files
--- ansible i inventory.ini -m shell -a " apt install openjdk" all
---  ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping ubuntu@IPAddress ---> If u want to 1 server or particular u can mention the server with ubuntu

GROUPING THE SERVERS____
___
So if we have multiple server like 5 db and 4 app server can we grp that server for db and app Yes... for that ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/446a9045-f29f-497f-8da8-61b4b59c52fc)
now asusual same command  ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping DB istead of all we need to mention what grp we need to run for eg; DB
So for simple Code or simple task like installing apache server,createing files on targetting server,restarting servers,or installing node server we can use adhoc commands....FOr long or complext for eg; terraform,CFT Advantage is resuable ,sharable,Github,collabrable

Day 3: Writing Your First Ansible Playbook

- Understanding YAML basics and Ansible playbook structure.
- Introduction to Ansible structure: Playbook, Play, Modules, Tasks and Collections.
- Hands-on: Writing a playbook to install apache2 and deploy a static app on aws.

  is yaml so what exactly is yaml the textbook definition says yaml is a human readable data serialization language what does that mean let's say you want to write a python application and this python application needs an input which can be as simple as list of users or list of students in a class so basically you want to pass some data as an input to your python application obviously this data can be fed to the python application in different ways one is you can pass this data as input using a text file you can pass this data as input using Json
  what's the problem with text file you know if I'm passing this information through a text file or data through a text file I don't need to learn any other languages such as Json or yaml so text file is not recommended especially if the data is simple it's still fine but imagine if the data is complex and has thousands of line text file is not recommended because it's not a proper format or there is no standard structure where data has to be put in a text file example maybe if I'm writing this text file I can put list of students name where each student name in a new line so someone else who is writing this text file they might put two students name in a single line or someone else who is writing this text file they might put first student name in the first line and maybe give some spaces and second student name in the third line third student name maybe in the Fifth Line so the problem if you are asking user to put the data in a text file and pass it to your application the data can be presented in different formats why because there is no standardization or a set requirement that text file has to be written in this format only otherwise your python application can throw a syntax error that's not possible because there is no syntax or semantics to a text file this is where templating languages such as Json or yaml comes into the picture so they are standard templating language files that are agreed accepted and defined according to the standards so if you don't write or if you don't put data into the Json file as per the requirement of the Json file then you will get syntax errors that means everyone who is writing a Json file or everyone who is writing a yaml file they need to follow a specific standard that's why you will see that in devops when you are passing some information either to kubernetes or to anible and many other applications you use standard templating language such as yaml where data is structured and available in a serialized way you might 

Day 4: Understanding Ansible Roles

- What are Ansible roles and why use them?
- Exploring the folder structure of Ansible roles.
- Comparing roles with playbooks and understanding their advantages.
- Hands-on: Creating a simple role and using it in a playbook.
roles so to explain roles in anable let me put you you some questions so in the previous example that we have seen there are only two task in the answerable Playbook because we were writing our very first answerable Playbook so we have chosen a very simple answerable Playbook that has only two tasks but imagine a scenario where you have an anible Playbook that has 50 number of tasks or an anible Playbook with 60 number of tasks not just the number of tasks but imagine a scenario where within your anible playbook you have post then you have multiple number of variables so let's say the case where you have 20 variables and then you have tasks where within the task section you might want to put some 40 50 tasks then you have something called handlers I'll explain what is handlers don't worry then you have the meta information of the anable Playbook so what happens in this case is not just that the size of your anible playbook goes high but this anible Playbook that you are writing will also lose things like readability right whoever is reading this anable Playbook imagine you open a Playbook yaml file right main. yaml file or you know your first Playbook do yaml file or whatever is the name of the Playbook you open a file and imagine you see 2,000 lines the moment you see this Playbook yaml file with 2,000 lines that is a red flag and will lose interest in reading the file but instead imagine the case where you can split this Playbook okay you can clearly see here there are multiple sections there is a section for variables there is a section for tasks there is a section for handlers there is a section for metadata what if you split the sections and each section you put in a different folder and within the folder you have individual yaml files you know at the first site you might feel it complicated you might think abishek I can write this entire playbook in one yaml file instead why should I create a folder for vs then why should I create a folder for tasks why should I create a folder for handlers why should I create a folder for meta in instead I can write only one yaml file but you know when you see a yaml file which is as simple as this everything looks good great but when you see the same yaml file with 2,000 lines immediately you will say that anible is complicated and I don't want to write the code in anible you know so that brings to the concept called as readability and modularity not just for anible for any programming language it can be python it can be go it can be even languages like terraform readability and modularity is very very important and to address that readability and modularity anible brings a concept called as roles where in simple language without any complication if you want to understand what is a role role is nothing but take a anible Playbook and if you split the different sections in the anible Playbook into different folders and place them under one umbrella called as role then that becomes Your anible Role so you don't ave to learn anything additional in terms of anible role all that you need to do is if you know how to write a anible Playbook yaml file you can just take the individual parts and put them under each and every folder now you might say but abishek do I need to create this folders each and every time is it not complicated don't worry what anible does is let me pull my terminal so anible can create that entire folder structure for you by just running one command and the command is an Galaxy so we are learning a new command at this point of time till now we learned two anible commands one is the anible command itself when you want to execute ad hoc commands next we learned anible Playbook command when you want to execute the anible playbooks now I am explaining a new command which is called as anible Galaxy and this command is going to play a very very crucial role because this command will simplify creating managing deleting and listing of the anible roles now let me quickly show you how to create a role using anible Galaxy it's very very simple all  that you need to do is anible Galaxy followed by role followed by in it right anible galaxy role in it and provide the name of the role that you want to create let's say the name of the role that I want to create is test so it said role test was created successfully

you keep telling complicated anible playbooks what exactly are they can you give some examples for sure let's take example of installing and configuring kubernetes you know not every organization go for managed kubernetes services such as e or AKs you know in your organization you might have a requirement to install kubernetes on the control nodes and the worker nodes terraform can create the infrastructure terraform is used to create the infrastructure right it's a ISC tool where you might spin up the ec2 instances VPC configuration but when you want to install the packages on the ec2 instances or the farget instances that is where anible comes into picture and this can be a complicated role because to install kubernetes you have your control nodes then you have your worker noes and on the control nodes you need to install and configure different workloads API server etcd then you have to set up uh container runtime container Network right and again on the worker nodes you might want to set up the cubet you might want to set up how worker nodes are joining with the uh control nodes so overall this Playbook like I've explained my easily go up to 50 60 tasks right so imagine you joined an organization and the seniors in the organization have given you a Playbook doyl file which has kubernetes installation and configuration you will see a file like this and immediately you will say it's very difficult to understand instead the same example kubernetes or another example let's say installation and configuration of databases like orle again there will be so many steps to install a version of orle configure that version of orle or any database so such things by using roles you can make your playbook more readable more modular and in future in future using the anible Galaxy you know anible provides something called as anible Galaxy the one that we saw here is the command line utility for the same right so using this anable galaxy you can create roles and you can upload that roles into this anible galaxy or to your GitHub and you can share the roles within your organization so the other advantage that roles brings here along with the routability and modularity this can be also shared across your or organization because roles can be uploaded to you know you can assume anable Galaxy as a Marketplace just like Docker has Docker Hub right Amazon has a Marketplace 

the other advantage that roles bring is readability modularity and also sharing across team's organization and across everyone outside your organization

How to convert ansible playook to role use the galaxy command ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66a3a280-ba53-48bd-a4a4-28dd11680382)

I explained this In First Class where if something is already available the thing that you are trying to do if it is already available on the target machine or the manage nodes anible will not execute that again if you're taking shell script or python for an example what happens with shell script if you're telling shell script to create a directory even though the directory is present okay for example if I do mkd ABC okay now ABC folder is available if I again do mkd ABC shell script will fail or the shell command will fail this nature is not called as itm poent whereas if you do the same thing with anel create a folder once and create the folder again anible will not create the folder because it says the folder is already available I don't have to create it this nature is called as item poent which is very important characteristic of anible that's why here you can see that the number of tasks are executed three but nothing is changed on the target machine so now let's connect to one of the ec2 instance and let's delete that HTM file let's see if an is going to create it or not that way we can confirm our roles are working right previously the configuration was already there so it did not create anything so let's take manage node one and uh connect let's use the E to instance connect I'll take the pseudo uh user and 

Day 5: Deep Dive into Ansible Roles with Demo(( Watch the 20 minutes from start u can understand how github creation nd rest)))

- Ansible Galaxy - Exploring pre-built Ansible roles.
- Ansible Galaxy - Importing and Installing roles.
- DEMO: Advanced usage of Ansible roles with a practical example project.
- Best practices for organizing roles and playbook structure.

   I'm also going to explain how to publish your anible roles onto the anible Galaxy this is very very important
03:03

because as a devop enger you write some anable playbooks and you might want to share it with other people in your organization outside your organization so that is done again using anible Galaxy we will learn that in this video we also have a demo where I'm going to show you if you are given a task to write a complicated configuration management task using anible how you can effectively use anible Galaxy to use some existing roles in the anable Galaxy server and how you can make your life as a devops engineer
03:42

simple you almost don't have to write code most of the times because most of the anible related modules task roles are already published to anible Galaxy so please watch this video till the end it's going to be very interesting so in the last class we had a glimpse of this website galaxy. an.
04:07

com where I've explained that anible Galaxy can be understood as a Marketplace for anible roles what does that mean in anible Galaxy you have thousands of ansible roles if you just go to the rool section you can see thousands of anible roles that are written and published by different devops in iners and system administrators for example if I am given a task let's say that I'm given a task to write an anable playbook for installation and configuration of Docker at the first site this might look very simple to you installing and
04:52

configuring Docker okay it's very easy but what if your anible control node talks to different manage nodes and you have to install Docker on all of these manage nodes where one of the manage node is using Red Hat Linux one of the manage node is maybe using Debian one of the manage node is using ubu one of the manage node is using Alpine right similarly one might be using windows so in each of these virtual machines the command that you use to install Docker changes the command that you use to create a Docker
05:41

user changes the command that you use to restart your Docker service might change so the complexity of the anable Playbook will go high when you have different kinds of configuration that's the whole purpose of anible right the configuration management where you you have different kinds of virtual machines even the simple things such as installation of Docker the complexity can be high because you have to handle different uh conditions in your anable playbook if the virtual machine is Red Hat then perform 1 2 3 four five tasks you know
06:20

if the virtual machine is Debian then perform different kind of tasks if the virtual machine is uban to you need to change the task so the number of tasks in your playbooks go High and the conditionals that you use also goes high so this is where instead of writing anable Playbook or anible role what you can do because Docker is a pretty common task first thing that you have to do is go to anible Galaxy and search and see if there is some role that suits your requirement I'll just search for Docker and I can see that okay there is a
06:58

anable role Docker for Linux and if I click on it I can read the documentation okay it says the role is tested on uban to Debian red hat so it is tested on multiple which suits most of my requirement and I can also look into the GitHub repository which hosts the source code for this role so I can also look at the GitHub repository and see the standard of the code that is written I can go to the task folder and I can see you know if I can actually trust this author or not so this is how anable roles can help you instead of writing common task if
07:44

you are lucky you might also find some tasks that are very unique to your organization but someone somewhere might have faced the similar requirement and you have a similar role in the anible Galaxy so like I explained in the last class this is the major advantage of anable roles it will bring modularity to your code right it will bring readability to your code and along with that you can also share the anible roles within your organization and outside your organization using anible Galaxy now saying all this abishek how
08:26

do I actually use the roles from this right if it is Docker Hub which is very similar to anible Galaxy right as a devop iner if you already know what is dockerhub it's similar to anible Galaxy where it's a Marketplace for Docker images you have thousands of Docker images and you can use the images using the docker CLI right I can use the docker CLI commands like Docker build Docker push Docker pull similarly for anible you you have something called as anible Galaxy just like for Docker Hub you have the docker C for anible Galaxy you have
09:09

this CLI utility called anible Galaxy most likely you will get the anible Galaxy installed along with your anible itself you can just search for anible Galaxy minus H you will see that you know it says it can be used for two major activities one is for collections and one is for rules exactly what you see here as well you know you have collections and roles at this point of time we are not discussing about collections our focus is roles so you can simply say anible Galaxy Ro minus H so what does it say it says that one
09:57

is it can do in it initial ization of a role which we saw in the last class where we created a role called httpd using anible Galaxy in it it created the complete folder structure for us with all the required basic files then it says remove just like in it initialize a anible uh role for you using remove you can remove any roles that are available in your role path then you can do delete list search import install and setup we will go step by step and we will try to understand how to use anible Galaxy for all our
10:41

activities the very first thing that I'll do is okay abishek let's talk about the activity that you have mentioned one is how can I use the anible rules that are available in anable Galaxy let's take the same example and can you show us how can we use this Docker anible role that is in the Galaxy so very simple what you need to do okay the very first thing that you do is set up an account with anible Galaxy very simple to your top right side you have the login button once you click on the login button you will see a page which asks
11:25

you to authenticate you can use your GitHub account so when you use your iub account you will be signed in with your GitHub user which is what I have done I'm signed in with my GitHub user and once you signed in just like others in the anible Galaxy you also get your anible role name space which is just like your anible Galaxy account or your user space at this point of time I haven't published any roles here so it says roles will appear once imported you know once I publish any roles to the anable Galaxy it will be shown here at
12:05

this point of time I haven't published any if you look at the previous user from which I was using the docker anible role if you go to this user so you can see in this users's role name space there are multiple anible roles because this user has published and this particular role is downloaded by 40 three people this particular role is downloaded by 62 this is 248 and this is 1783 so it's almost like a community work where you are sharing your anible role with others perfect now our topic of interest
12:45

is Docker so first let's see how to install this role so I don't have anything I just have my previous anable playbooks and rules which we have written till day four now I'll implement the task where I will install and configure Docker on two of my manage notes which I have set up with passwordless authentication in day two so for that first thing that you do is go back to your anel Galaxy just copy this command here what does it say anible Galaxy rooll install this particular role and as soon as I do that it says
13:30

role installed you know basically I already have this role while I was doing the demo I have installed it so it says already installed now where does this role go so if you just do LS tilt a hidden folder called anible roles so you can see all the roles that you have installed so it says I have installed these three roles so this is the one that you should see when you run the command and where will you see in the home directory do anible folder which is a hidden folder and inside that you have roles perfect now I have this particular
14:17

thing which says the docker role is installed but abishek how do I use that role in the last class when we wrote our very first anible role you said in the first Playbook do yaml that is in the Playbook you just mention the reference and say roles as httpd and it understood that httpd is available in the same folder so it started using it there is no difference you can do the same thing where what I'll do is I'll just copy the same Playbook okay copy or let me write it so whm docker Playbook do yaml so I'll start with
15:04

three hyphens then I'll just say host all then I'll say become true or remote user root you can use anything then I'll say roles what was the name of the role we need to check that again just copy this one and and paste it here okay now let's save this file and run the command anible Playbook minus I inventory file followed by Docker Playbook do yaml and that's it you will see all the tasks that are involved if you go to the task. yaml or the main.
16:00

yaml you can see that it has so much code like almost 20 plus tasks here and you have additional yl files where you have setup dean. yaml which is specific like the task specific to Debian then you have task specific to Red Hat path specific to Docker compose so instead of writing this complicated anable Playbook what did I do is I just used the existing anible role in Galaxy and I have installed and configured Docker on my ec2 instances now you can simply log into this e to instance just for your verification and you can see that Docker
16:42

should be installed please try to do this activity uh you know it helps you a lot of times as a devops engineer writing and sible roles will take a lot of time for example kubernetes or database installation configuration you can use the Galaxy and reduce significant amount of time so let's do Docker and see perfect so Docker is installed and Docker user is created all the required things are set up using anible Galaxy if you want to try it out you can create Red Hat you can create Alpine and give it a try you will see that anable Galaxy
17:25

works because the tasks are written for different possibilities it is written for Debian it is written for red hat and also ubo perfect now okay abishek I understood half of it where I can use anible roles in the Galaxy but what if as a devops engineer I want to publish roles to this anible galaxy so in the last class we wrote this anible rule right we wrote the httpd now how do I publish this so very simple thing one thing that you have to understand is anible rules should always be put in GitHub and should be imported into the anable
18:11

Galaxy right same thing we did here also when we are using this anible rule for Docker the source code is pushed to GitHub pushed to a GitHub repository and this particular user has imported this GitHub repository we have to do exactly same thing so if you have a existing anable role first go to that folder httpd and what you need to do is in your GitHub create a new repository okay go to the home space and first create a new repository don't worry all these steps are also mentioned in the anible Z to Hero GitHub repository I have provided
18:58

the notes you can go to the repository and you can read through it and you can also execute or watch this video and execute so let's say dumy Rule and let's provide a description a dummy anible role for demo okay it's a public repository let's keep it and create the repository so I've created this repository now what I'll do is with within this folder okay I think I already have let me delete dogit because I have done the demo previously so what you need to do is first do the git in it okay I have initialized an empty G
19:47

repository now you can just copy the https URL you also have the commands here you can use the commands end of the day what I'm doing is I'm just pushing all the source code here to the GitHub repository that's it you have different ways to do it but I'm trying to explain the simple way now you will do the command get remote origin add this sorry you will do get remote add origin followed by this my bad okay now if you do get remote minus V perfect this is added now all that you need to do is just add stage the files now just
20:39

say get commit minus M initial files whatever you wouldd like to call right and now just push this get push origin main perfect now you should once you refresh you should see that your anible role is pushed onto the GitHub repository and here you will see all the dummy information and where is this getting populated from you can update this readme file so that you can write the appropriate things now I'm not spending time updating this but one thing that you should definitely do is update this meta folder and within the
21:26

meta folder update the main. jaml where you provide all the details like who is the author what is the description what is the company these details have to be definitely mentioned otherwise within your organization people will not understand why is this role written who has written it all this information in the meta yaml file is very very important to write now the only thing that is left is okay abishek the role is also publish to GitHub repository now how do I push it to anible Galaxy so for that you have
22:03

the command anible Galaxy import your GitHub username followed by the name of the repository dami roll right so it will throw the authentication error okay so you have done everything but still it is through throwing authentication error because the first thing that you have to do is you need to go to the anable Galaxy and if you go to the collection collection section you will find API token just load the token copy it and pass it to your anible Galaxy hyphen hyphen token and now you will see that your anible role will be published to Galaxy
22:57

and anybody can start using it there are ways to secure your token as well don't worry I will be showing it you can uh secure by adding it to a file you can also add it to your anable configuration but for now let's see now if I go to my roles if I go to my role name space abishek vamala see there is a role that we have published few seconds ago abishek has published dumy rooll now anybody can look into this documentation which I have not not updated as I mentioned you need to come here and update the readme file it's
23:35

very important like you have seen the previous rule that we have used for Docker installation this file was very very neatly updated see if you go here you can see that the main. yaml so the readme.md is updated accurately that's why it's reflected on the anable Galaxy as well but because I'm doing a demo I have not written that entire thing in your organization you have to write it very clearly and the installation step is anybody who wants to use it they can run this command and just like how we use
24:11

the docker role they can use this anible role which is a dummy role that we have written so this is how you write your own anible role and publish it or use existing anible roles from the anible Galaxy task like Docker and installation kubernetes installation E2 installation most of it will already be available in the anible Galaxy so this is the video for today I hope you have enjoyed it next videos are going to be even more interesting so please try to watch see you all in the next one take care bye-bye


Day 6: Ansible Variables and Precedence

- Create AWS Resources using Ansible (Collections)
- Understanding Ansible variables and their scope with an example
- Jinja2 Templating - Utilizing advanced templating features
- Variable precedence: How Ansible resolves conflicts between different variable sources.
- Hands-on: Using variables in playbooks and roles.
hello everyone my name is Abhishek and welcome back to my Channel today is episode 6 of anible Zero to Hero Series this is a 14 episode series and till now we have completed five episodes in this series starting with episode one where we learned about the basics of anible and getting started with it then in episode two we learned about anible ADH commands along with that we also learned about passwordless authentication inventory file in anible in episode three we learned how to write our very first anable Playbookalong with that we also learned about the basics of yaml so how to write simple yaml files what are the data types that are available in yaml and how to use them in episode 4 we started our journey with anible roles so I've explained the folder structure of anible roles what is the difference between anible playbooks ad hoc commands and anible roles we also learned how to write a simple anible role we have done a Hands-On in episode 4 episode 5 is basically an extension of episode 4 because in episode five wedeep dived into the anible roles where we learned how to use anible Galaxy to use the pre-built anible roles or existing anible roles from the anible Galaxy we have also done a demo where I have shown how to install Docker on ec2 instances using anible where we have used the docker role from anible Gala from a particular username space so this was the first five episodes of this series today is episode 6 where we will learn about anible variables and precedence of anible variables now I not directly jump intoanible variables but we will start with an example what I'll do is I will explain how to create AWS resources such as ec2 instance or S3 bucket using anible so we will be using the anible AWS collection for this and once we write this anible role we will learn how using variables we can improvise the project that we have written in step one so we can see the real use case of anable variables we'll also learn about Ginger to templating which is a standard of using the variables in anible finally we will talk about aniblevariable precedence basically in anible you have multiple places where you can declare the variables so what is the order of priority that is what we will learn in variable precedence part for the people who are new complete notes will be provided in the same GitHub repository so you have twise folder structure if you go to any of these folders you can find the files which will have the Playbook doyl files or the theory part everything will be shared through the folder wise in the GitHub repository so you can start thisrepository FK it to get the updates okay now let's jump into the video and start understanding how to create AWS resources or in general any of the third party resources using anible so till now what we have done is we have used anable right so on the control node which is our laptop till now what we have done is we have installed anible and we were using the manage notes so the manage nodes were on AWS so we were using ec2 instances so we connected to these ec2 instances using the passwordless authenticationand we were creating uh the httpd packages or we were installing uh Docker something like that so what were we doing till now we were using Anvil to connect to this ec2 instances through SSH protocol or passwordless Authentication Protocol and The Playbook or the roles that you were writing they were installing a module on the ec2 instance right whatever the code that you are writing whatever the yaml files that you are writing let's say you are writing a yaml file which will do something like apt install Dockeranything so after connecting to this e to instances through the passwordless way anible installs a module on this E2 instances and the module is executed because there is python that is already installed on this manage noes so this is what we were doing but now let's say there is a use case where using anible so on the control node we have anible and what you want to do is instead of talking to your virtual machines you actually want to talk to the apis so now my use case is to the talk to the API of AWS and create some resources on AWS itcan be ec2 it can be uh S3 bucket and not just AWS it can be Azure it can be gcp or it can be any network appliances like Cisco how will you tackle this situation because in the scenario number one you have a virtual machine you can connect with passwordless authentication install a module and module gets executed and create resources here but now we want to talk through the API so for this purpose what you can do in anible is I mean you don't have to do anything but when you use the anible AWS modules or when you use anible uh Ciscomodules or when you use ansible Azure modules so what anible does is anible installs the module on your control node or on your Local Host okay it doesn't connect to the appliances or AWS or anything through the passwordless authentication but instead it installs the module on the same machine on the control node and when this module is executed it will talk to the API because end of the day what is this module it is basically a python code which anible executes so anible runs the python code on your local machine and this python code talksto the apis of AWS or talks to the apis of Cisco or azure gcp whatever it is where we will come to know about these things what are the supported things in anible so there is a concept in anible called as collections in the previous classes I have explained that we will come back to the concept called collection so if you go to the anable documentation you have these collections so you have collection for open stack you have collection for uh net app which is a storage related thing you have collection for kubernetes youhave collection for info blocks grafana Google namespace which is your uh gke gcp you have fi networks for the big IP let's say if you go to this one so fi has a network Appliance right if you go to this documentation so fi provides a collection and using these modules you are not doing anything you will do the same thing as a user step one and step two is exactly same for you you are not doing anything different you are only providing yaml as an input for your anel so as a user your steps are the same you write a yaml fileeither in the format of Playbook or in the format of role but how anible talks to these things is different when you want to use an ible buil-in roles I mean the buil-in modules such as apt or Yem or the uh file module whatever we learned till now or the built-in modules where they directly SSH to the Target virtual machine to the manage notes and execute the modules on them here when you're using the collections like AWS Cisco or Azure they will not be sshing to AWS because it's not possible right when you want to create resourceson AWS you cannot SSH to the AWS platform because it is not supported all that you can do is talk to the AWS using API so as a user you will write the same yaml file and anible executes the module on your control node and talk to the API of AWS of course you need to provide the password authentication for the API which we will learn in the next steps for now this is what we do and if you want to understand what are the things that are supported you will go to the anible documentation and see okay anible supports IBM aniblesupports Google grafana kubernetes net app open stack and Etc now the next question is abishek just like pre-built modules right um these are the pre-built anible modules which are nothing but if you go to anible builtin you can see all that we were using like the APT module copy module or the file module these modules are directly available in the anible installation right what we did in the last class if you go to so in the first Playbook that we have written so what did we do we wrote a role and inside the HTTP role in thetask so we are directly using these modules right the anible buil-in APT or built-in copy we were not doing any installation we are directly using them but when it comes to the collections like AWS what is a collection anything apart from the anable buil-in modules like the APT module or copy module cron module file module apart from that if you want to talk to any third parties like AWS or Azure or Google so anible has a concept called collection so this collection is basically a combination of roles modulesanything that is related to that third party tool if you go to the AWS collection okay it is called as Amazon collection so just go to collections in Amazon namespace click on that and you will find the module for ec2 just search for ec2 okay these are the modules related to ec2 similarly you have modules for IM am you have modules for S3 RDS Route 53 mostly everything that is present on AWS to use these modules okay for pre-built modules or the built-in modules we are directly using them but to use them theAWS one what you have to do is first install this collection that's the only step and to install the AWS collection in the day6 folder I have already provided the step so if you go to the day6 folder so this is the step that you need to do anible Galaxy collection install Amazon AWS abishek how did you find this command again it's very simple just go to anible Galaxy okay in the anable Galaxy similarly just like we have roles we have a section called collections go to the name spaces of Collections and hereyou can search for Amazon and when you search for Amazon you have the AWS thing you have the documentation which is same in the anible official documentation and you have the install command so this is the same thing I have copied from here and I have put that in the MD file so our first step is to install this okay I'll take my uh terminal here you can use any of your terminal I'm just using the visual studio terminal only it says I already have it and if I want to force with the latest version I can just doforce in your case also you might have it in the anable installation you might get some collections or otherwise use this command to install the AWS collection okay because I have forced the installation uh it has installed it one more time and one more thing to understand is for certain collections you might have some prerequisites you will find them in the do documentation for AWS collection one is you have to install the collection itself and second on your laptop or on your control node because I said on the anable control node themodule is executed and the module talks to the AWS API if you know python you know that in Python there is a module called boto3 which is quite popular we have learned in the AWS series as well this is the module which anible use to talk to the API of AWS so on your control node you should also have boto 3 installed so this is again a prerequisite if you don't have boto 3 the execution will fail because anel cannot talk to the AWS apis so what I'll do is I'll just run pip install boto3 a point to rememberhere if you are on different uh operating system or if you're on a different uh architecture this command might change and sometimes you might have to use pip X or you might have to use pip 3 depending upon your python installation but at this point of time just make sure boto 3 is installed successfully okay in my machine I have just installed uh it is already available so it says uh requirements already satisfied and boto 3 is available so I'm done with two things I have boto 3 installed I also have the AWS collection available nowI'm ready to use any of this AWS modules till now what I've done is I've just set the platform to use any of these modules in my anable playbooks now let's get started with writing the creation of ec2 instance so you have this module ec2 instance module you can read through this uh if you want because there are a lot of parameters that you can pass right uh what I'll do is I'll just take one of the examples so this is one example which says start an instance with public IP address or if you want you can pick upany other examples as well you can pick up the example from my documentation also so even I have provided a documentation example here so we will be using this just copy this one go to your Visual Studio code don't worry I'm going to explain each and every line line that is available there so first we'll create a folder let's call this as ec2 creation or just call it as ec2 that's fine and inside this first I'll create a file let me call this as ec2 DOL or E2 uncore create. yl of course I need an inventory file because without the inventory file anel does not understand where it has to execute these things in this case of course if you go to the example here anable is actually executing on the control node itself so there are no manage nodes so you ideally don't have to uh you know provide your manage notes because your talking to the AWS API and the module is executing on your control node but it's a good practice that you always maintain your inventory file so I'll just use the same inventoryfile that I have previously because I haven't changed any of my control notes I'll be using the same things let me paste it here so I have this thing one is the app one is the DB I have just two easy to inst stances now let's try to understand what is written here now I haven't jumped to the concept of variables yet because first I want you to understand what kind of answerable playbooks you will write and how you will variabe those anable playbooks what is the advantage of using anable variables before that we need tosee a anable Playbook itself so first I'm saying the host as Local Host let's try to compare with the previous thing that we have written so previously we have written host as all but here I've written host as Local Host what is the difference the same thing that I've explained here we are running on all the ec2 instances connecting to them with the passwordless authentication but here I'm running on the same machine so my host will be Local Host connection local this tells anible that okay the Playbook has to beexecuted on the same machine so this is something that you have to definitely write now you can either write the task here or as we were doing previously what you can do is you can Define roles and in the roles you can define a role let me call this role as ec2 and using anible Galaxy so anible Galaxy role in it E2 so it has created a role called ec2 and you must have seen in the previous classes it creates a bunch of uh files and folders for us so if you go to the ah my bad I'm in the wrong folderstructure let [Music] me we need to do that again so we will go to ec2 and we will run the command again anible Galaxy rooll initialization E2 and you can see the folder is created for E2 where you have the complete folder structure that I have explained in the previous classes you have defaults files handlers meta task templates tests and vs okay abishek we have the role that is available now in the role go to the task go to the main. yaml and paste what you have copied so you can remove the task section and align this entire thing okay I just have one task and the task is to start a easy to instance with public IP address now abishek when I'm dealing with AWS okay you have mentioned that I need to talk to the AWS apis but when I have to talk to the AWS apis I need to use my API keys in the AWS world we will be using the AWS access key and the secret ID right which we will get for I am user how do we secure this I cannot directly put them in the anable playbooks right if I'm using a e toinstance creation logic I need to pass the access key and I need to pass the secret key but if I directly them in the anible Playbook anybody who is watching this anible Playbook or when we actually check this into a GitHub repository the secret key and the access key are compromised so there is a security issue how do we solve this so anible has a buil-in vaal integration what is vaal vaal is basically like a security thing where you can secure your uh variables you can secure your passwords you can secure your API tokens right so anible has abuil-in VA integration which is called as anible VA so what we are going to do next is before executing this okay I've taken this entire example from the anible documentation I know what are the things that are required for the EO instance creation I need the instance type I need the security group I need the region I need the image ID tags is not mandatory I can just remove this as well and I need the access key and the secret key now how do we secure this I have steps for that as well they are very very simplesteps in other tools like terraform or genkins you might have to perform the installation of Vault but anible comes with the predefined installation you just need to execute two commands one is you create a password for accessing the sensitive information that you put in Vault just like you put any of your uh secret documents or any of your assets in a vault in a real Vault you will have a password for that Vault right similarly even for the anible vault first we will create a password I'm using op SSL for creating arandom Bas 64 uh encoded password if you want to use you can also use a secure one with a very good encryption but for the demo let's use this so we will be first creating a base 64 encoded password uh that is stored in the file called wall. pass and this is the command for basically creating the passwords in the vault what is this command doing anible Vault uh this is not edit actually first you need to use create anible VA create so I'm creating a file which has the password and I am accessing the file with the Vaultpassword okay the Vault password that we have created in the previous step very simple just like you use a real Vault or real safe for securing your assets you have a password for that Vault similarly in the anable vault also you can create any files and it is better to secure that file that you are creating with a password so first I'm creating that and here it is asking okay do you want to add anything to the file that is to the W yes I want to add what I want to add I want to add two things one is AWS accesskey second one that I want to add is AWS secret key and what are the values for this so this is my AWS console and you have this section called security credentials you can use the root IM user you can use any IM user that you want but in general in the organization you will not be using the root IM user you will be using your own IM user dedicated to anible with the permissions that it required to have but for the purpose of demo I will show you let me create a access key here copy the access key paste it here secret key let me pausethe video because it will have some sensitive information okay I have added that to the anible VA and I have saved the file using colon WQ exclamatory I have saved the file now what will happen after this is using the ginger to templating I'll explain the ginger to templating again when I explain about variables I'll be talking about variables after this because I'm going to show how to improvise this playbook for now whenever you see this kind of double curly brackets inside the double curly brackets if you placeanything that means anible will understand okay abishek wants to reference some variable how do you read a variable from anible Vault it's very simple you don't have to do anything whenever you store a variable in anible VA you can directly access them put double codes and within the double codes just put the variable that is in your anable Vault so I have my ec2 access key and secret key in the vault so now let's see by executing this Playbook so how will we execute it we will just say anible Playbook and uh then I will just run thecommand minus I inventory of course inventory file you don't have to pass any of your manage notes but just let's pass the inventory file and E to create. yaml this will fail let's see why so so it said attempting to decrypt but no VA Secrets found this is what I have explained right you put the secrets in the answerable vault and you have secured this Vault with a password right you have secured this Vault with a base 64 encoded password in real time in production scenarios you will not be using B 64encoded password you will be using a encryption mechanism you can be using uh sha 1 sha 256 anything that your organization recommends now when you are executing the anible Playbook anible will try to read the passwords from anible Vault and when it tries to read the password from The Vault it is secured with a base 64 encoded password in our case and will need to know how to decrypt it and what is the password so what you need to do is you need to pass the VA file when you pass this VA file anible will understand okay how can I decryptit so let's pass that for that we will just run the same command but this time anible Playbook with wal password file wall. pass now let's execute this okay create e2. yaml does not exist let's see if we are in the right file it's e toore create. yl e toore create. yaml okay it failed let's see why it failed and we can debug it so it said there is some syntax problem in line three column 3 let's go to the task main. yaml it said there is some uh syntax issue let's see what is that syntax issue okay this looks good we can just remove this for the purpose of clarity okay we have the name as anable instance this looks good here also it looks good let's try it one more time to see we can use anable linting but I just want to understand what is going wrong and try to explain okay it says EC toore access key is underdefined from VA as defined okay let me see if I have done something wrong E2 uncore accessor key is not defined so this is my VA file do I haveah yeah so I actually need to update this easy to access key my bad I have put this one perfect now I have edited the wall thing and uh let me execute one more time okay not this and so we Playbook command okay the first step is always gather facts and uh now the second step is it is trying to install the ec2 perfect it said two tasks were executed one is The Gather fact and other is easy to instance creation it said it changed one let's go to my AWS console we should see a is 2 instance getting created let's goto ec2 we should be in the US East one region yes we are in the US East one and one instance is running see it's still initializing because it is something that we have just created and it got created with the public IP intentionally I did not pass a key value pair if you want you can pass the key value pair but I don't want to connect to this instance I'll delete delet it immediately so I did not bother uh creating a key value pair perfect so now we learned how to use collections till now I did not talkabout variables but what did we learn till now so till this point of time we learned how to use collections in anible this is a very important concept because anible built-in modules can help you to some extent for automating your regular task but when you want to use anible for infrastructure provisioning like creating resources on AWS or when you want to use anible for Network automation we have a dedicated class for Network automation again we might repeat some of these things but for provisioning of infrastructure ornetwork automation you need the concept like collections because either the network appliances or the pass platforms SAS platforms IAS platforms like AWS they need to be interacted through the apis and to talk to the apis of them so anible provides Collections and this collections will have roles modules and other things where they get executed on your control node the buil-in modules they get executed they get installed on the manage nodes as modules and on your manage node you will have Python and they get executed it can be the copymodule or it can be the shell module or it can be the APT module they are running directly on your manage node but the infrastructure provisioning or network automation they run on your control node and they talk to the apis of AWS or uh Cisco or fi any of these things because you cannot directly talk to them through the SSH they will not have the protocols like SSH you cannot connect to the AWS console through the SSH prot protocol you cannot connect to fi through the SSH protocol that's why the only medium isto talk through the apis perfect so we learned how to install collection once we install the collection it is again important to understand each collection will have prerequisites in case of AWS we saw the prerequisites were installation of boto 3 we saw the prere site was installation of AWS collection only the two steps of course you need to use the Vault for securing your AWS access key and uh secret key so these were the steps that we have done till enough now the question is abishek everything is perfect why do I needvariables because right now what I've done I have created an ec2 instance and I can share this Playbook with anyone and they can also create an E2 instance but just like any programming language If You observe the anible Playbook that you have written if you watch The Playbook that you have written very carefully all of the things or most of the things here are hardcoded so what happens because of this is if you share this Playbook with anyone else whenever they create the E to instance they will get the same image IDI mean they will be using the same Ubuntu again and again what if you want to share this anable Playbook with someone and they don't want Ubuntu they might be the requirement is Windows or their requirement is Cent OS just like that you might share this with someone else and they don't want T2 micro they might want T2 medium or T2 extra large so hard coding not just in anible but in any programming language is a bad practice either you're writing shell scripting python anible you should not be hardcoding any of these things so ifyou hardcode what happens your playbook is restricted to a particular thing only whereas if you varize this you can share this with anyone and they can you know instead of using T2 micro they can use anything else how do you do that in anel the concept is same just like any programming language you will be using variables but one complexity in the case of anel yes you will use variables but there are multiple places in fact the complexity comes into picture because if you go to anible documentation there are 22 places if I'm right yeah sothere are 22 places in which you can declare variables in anible I think even in my experience anible is the one where you have multiple places to declare the variables and 22 is actually very complicated and to be honest I think this is something that anable can imp proof of course Anil says that it is for the purpose of uh flexibility it is for the purpose of uh you know allowing the users to use variables according to their uh use cases but personally I feel that you know anible makes it Complicated by allowing users to declarevariables at multiple places anything at this point of time you cannot do anything uh you have variables that you can declare in multiple places we will see what are the most common places and what happens if you declare variables in if we go back what happens if you declare as role default what happens if you declare as extra War which has priority than the other things first let's start with the simple one as we learned in the last class I have explained you can declare the variables when you create a role in thefolder structure you have a folder for defaults and in the defaults I said you can just declare anything here now in the main. yaml let's variabe the instance type so what I'll be doing in the defaults main. yaml I can just come here I can say let me just say type type and uh you can provide a value here so what will be the value I'll say t2.micro and in this file we can reference that variable and we can say so this is the gja to templating standard how you will use the variable so two steps right in any programming language you will be doing two steps for a variable one is you define or declare a variable that's what we did here so here we Define and declare the variable second is you use the variable and to use the variable in anible you will be using the ginger to templating standard where two curly braces open close two curly braces and within that you need towrite type okay so now what happens is it is exactly same but instead of hardcoding it we are referencing the variable let's close the other files to make it easy yeah so I am referencing the variable from the defaults mainl how will anible know that okay abishek has put something in the defaults main. yaml you don't have to worry about it anible will load the variable from default mains. yaml or vs main. yaml in any of these 22 places you know just like default. yl main. yl V main. yl and in other places that I'm going to explain in any of these places you can Define and declare a variable anible is going to load it you don't have to do anything extra so it's anable task now let's see if there is any change okay have just variz this Playbook let me see if I run this again okay it said instance type type and there is some uh typohere so let's just put the double quote perfect and let's run it again okay so it said Gathering facts and it said there is some syntax problem error type is undefined okay let's see if there is any mistake let's go to the default main. yaml I have provided type I hope I have Define it inside defaults main. yaml perfect and uh here here inside the ec2 inside the defaults inside the main. yaml I have type as T2 micro and within the task main. yaml I'm using the type so it's all good let me run it one more time perfect you can see that ok2 changed is zero that means there is no difference previously the E2 instance was created and now I have just variabe the Playbook and it says nothing has changed but abishek then why did you variabe it's very simple right anyone who wants to use this Playbook if you use this standard style they can saysimply go to the default mains. yaml and they can simply update it here it is always a practice to update the variables rather than updating the code directly it is not in anible it is in every programming language it's a standard that you should not allow the users to update the code but you should provide them with the steps to update the variables that's the only thing otherwise you know anybody can come to the code and they might change something it might break so instead you say all the variables are in the default filejust go here and update and you will get the ac2 instance of your type similarly your task is to you know variabe the region variabe the uh Ami ID everything that is available here I'm not going into it right you can do it just like how I have done the type now the next thing is okay abishek uh I have variz this in the default mains. yl then why do I have multiple other things that's what I said anible has variables places to declare let me show you if I declare the same thing in the v mains. yaml right let me remove this and I will Define the same thing type and I will say T2 do medium so now I've given a conflicting information to anel right in default mains. yl I said oh my bad let me just uh remove this so in the default mains. main. I think I've done that mistake uh here as well I shouldn't be putting the double quote never mind so here I said t2. micro and in vs M.L I said t2. medium that means I've given same variable to anable and I've given conflicting information this is where variable precedence comes into picture now anible will see okay out of this 22 places abishek has defined the same thing in role defaults and abishek has defined the same thing in the rolevariables okay it's somewhere down here the role variables so role variables has more idence when compared to the role defaults that is this one has more priority than the one that you have declared in the default main. let's go to AWS here um yeah I have multiple tabs sorry and uh let's terminate the instance perfect I have terminated the instance and now let's give it just one minute perfect the instance is terminated now let's try to execute it again yeah we can get rid of this gather facts you can just disable The Gatherfacts in your playbook and this task will not run okay it said one got changed and now let's see if I go to the instances one more time this is a new instance it's pending creation but we should see the type as T2 medium and if you go to the previous instance if we still have it yeah luckily the type was t2.micro so what did we understand we understood that the Precedence for vs main. yaml is more than defaults main. yaml abishek why did anible do this as the name suggests you can put your defaults here so sometimes as a devops engineer you will write the Playbook yaml and you will share it with multiple teams so some of the teams they might have their custom variable values instead of updating that directly in the default main. yaml what they will do is they will come to the vs main. yaml and they will just have their own version of the variables this is just another way of you know not updating the variables each and every time rather than creating their own variable file and if they use that in the vs main. yaml everything in the defaults will get overridden so this is one way of anible saying that okay if you have a sub project if you have another team your devops team might be sharing the anable Playbook with all the default variables the sub team or the developers they canuse their own vs and they can override the things if you have done this just like what I've have done uh make sure you terminate the instance because I have just created a T2 medium one and T2 medium is basically charged by AWS so delete it immediately perfect now abishek are there any other places yes for sure there are multiple other places like this comes with the the least precedence or the lowest priority you don't have to remember all the 22 ones you just remember what I'm going to explain andif someone asks in the interview you can say that I reference the anable official documentation if someone asked me about the variable precedence I don't remember all the 22 ones I just look at the anable documentation and I will just reference which one has more priority than the other one because there is no point you will not get any extra points if you remember these 22 things uh it's almost impossible to remember so default means has the lowest precedence you can see here also it comes up in the ladder command linevalues are actually not variables so if you ignore that role defaults has the lowest precedence and you can use you can just say minus e which stands for extra vs and you can just say type is equals to t2. micro let's again say t2. micro previously we saw vs has overridden the default ones now if I provide minus E type t2.micro and if you just run this one you will see a new E2 instance will be created and this time again it will be created with type T2 micro why because extra has the highest precedence okay change this one and if you go back to my ec2 search on the instances let me reload and uh instances this is the new one that that's in the running State and again it's du to micro why because if you look at the variable precedence extra has the highest precedence so you need to remember these basic things that defaults has thelowest precedence so anybody can update if you are a devops engineer highly recommend that use the default mains. yaml because you are sharing this Playbook with others it's up to them if they want to override you will be writing a generalized Playbook you can allow others to override it so default M.L is the place where we update the variable files uh variable values and it can be overridden by the project teams developers through the vs main. yaml and super power is extra vs anybody using the anible Playbook command line they can just pass minus E or hyphen hyen extra vs and it's the same either you can use hyphen e or hyphen I extra vs and you can pass the variable this comes with the highest precedence it will override anything they might have declared the variable in any of these 21 places it will be overridden by the extra so it's the super power or highestprecedence thing apart from that the most common places is you know you can also declare the variable here you can just say vs and you can say type T2 do micro or anything so this is another place where you can reference a variable and this is again a popular one because uh you know whenever you are writing the uh Playbook some people also reference the variable directly for this play you can use the variable here and when you write the another play again just provide the name and define the variables for the player right so youcan here say name abishek something like this either you can U reference it uh from the ginger my bad here you have to provide a value right so type t2. micro it it's the other way around you should not be using Ginger 2 templating here Ginger 2 is used when you actually use the variable my bad so you can use it here and there is one more popular place where you can use the variables that is in the group variables what is group variables so in the inventory file if you if you observe carefully I have grouped the variables uh sorry group Themanage nodes right I have grouped this manage node as app I might have 10 app manage nodes I have grouped this as DB I might have 10 DB instances if you want to use a variable that only applies for app instance sometimes you know you might have use cases where you have a variable and for app the value of the variable is different for DB the value of the variable is different best example is let's say you have password you know you might have a password that is different for your app instances and different for your DBinstances in such cases what you can do is create a folder called group VES I created it for uh the Walt thing just we created inside this group VES create a file and if you create a file called app. yaml and inside this app. yaml app.yaml or yml if you provide any variable like let's say password just giving a blunt example and if you provide a value of the password something like this now this password will only apply to the group called app inside your inventry file so you can create another file called db. yaml and that will only applyto the ventory files in the TB as we move forward in the classes we will learn about these things you don't have to worry so what we are going to do is we are going to use variables a lot so I will be using variable in different places but the important ones are these things that I've have explained defaults main.yaml most of the times you will be using this vs main. yaml a place where developers or projects or sub teams they might use this variable file to overwrite the ones that you have written in the Playbook doyl groups very very important because when you have a variable with value different for group of instances like app instance and DB instance inside the group v.l you will create the same password for App instance different and the DB instance different finally you have have extra vs which is like a super power can override any of these things if you have time you can go through this uh documentation and refer what are the different other PES where you can include the variables I've also spoken about adding the defining the variables directly inside this uh Playbook also like that we have 22 and answerable don't remember everything it's not at all uh important that youunderstand the uh precedence of it but if you have time just go through the documentation see how it is declared in different places that's enough if someone asks you in the interview you can simply tell them that okay if it comes to the variable precedence uh this is what I'll do I'll go to the official documentation and I'll see but the most common places that I use is defaults VES inside the Playbook extra VES and the group VES thank you so much for watching today today's video I hope you enjoyedit and in the next classes we will be learning about more exciting things of anbel see you all take care everyone bye-bye
Day 7: Ansible Conditionals and Loops

- Using conditionals in Ansible to control task execution.
- Implementing loops for repetitive tasks.
- Practical examples of conditionals and loops in playbooks.

Day 8: Error Handling in Ansible

- Dealing with errors and failures in Ansible playbooks.
- Error handling techniques and best practices.
- Demonstrating error handling in practical scenarios.

the order of of execution of task in anible now this is very important to understand before we move towards  understanding error handling in anable 

how anible executes this task is that first anible takes the task number one anible completes the execution of task number one on all the manage notes it can be 3 10 100 only when task number one understand this carefully only when task number one is complete and when task number one is complete and successful anible will move to the task number two and only when task number two is complete and successful anible will move to the task number three if it exists so if task number one fails anible does not execute any any tasks that are followed by task number one now this is very good this is the default nature of anible and you know it is good for many reasons if your task number one has failed and in the Playbook let's say there are 100 tasks what anible is doing by default it says that see the task number one itself failed why should I execute other 99 tasks it's waste of time and it's waste of the sources like in many ways it's a good behavior but in some cases this can also be a problem for you as a devops--- real world scenario a day-to-day task of a devops Engineer

this default execution nature of anible can be a problem so as a devops engineer you are given a task by a project team where the task is a configuration management activity on all the manage nodes or all the servers that are associated with this project Team all the virtual machines that are associated with this project teams so they have given a task to a devops engineer that is step step one overall what they want through this task is to install Docker but they have some conditions that is step one first before installing Docker they want to make sure that the open SSH and open SSL packages on those virtual machines if this pack P ages exist on this virtual machine before installing Docker this project team for security reasons they are asking devops Engineers to make sure that this packages are with the latest version  only if these packages exist on the virtual machine they want the packages should be latest version if this packages does not exist no problem hat is verify if Docker is installed finally you can move to task number step number three that is install docker these are the prerequisites 
they ask you to write anible Playbook now in this case the default nature of anible can create a problem it can create an issue because you know out of this 10 virtual machines some of them might not have open SSH and if they don't have op ssh in anable Playbook when you write app that is anible built-in app and you say the name as let's say open SSH 
ignoring manage node one so this is a problem right because you want to install Docker on all the 10 manage nodes how do you solve this error so this particular thing is called as error handling like in every programming
language even in anible you have the concept called error handling where if required you can handle the errors actually it's an error but you can handle it saying that it's okay even though it's an error I want to proceed so this particular nature is called as error handling and in anible the Syntax for error handling is on any task where you want to handle errors you can simply write ignore errors yes FYI![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9133b61-cd29-4384-9be8-137ea426ebc7)
Just as a example---if the devops engineer comes up with a anable Playbook and within that anable Playbook if there are let's say three tasks and there are three manage nodes so if task one let's say it failed on manage node one manage node 2 and manage node three then task number two will not execute on a any of the manage nodes but instead if task number one has failed only on the manage node one and succeeded on manage note two and three what happens with the next task it will run on task two and task three but anible will ignore this host right anible will ignore a host if at least one task fails on that you are handling that situation using the error handling concept of ansible...
let's try to take a look at this practically okay so what I am going to do is I will take my visual studio code and I already have two ec2 instances which are connected with the passwordless authentication with the anable control node which is my laptop we have been doing this from the previous videos also if you just go to the running State you can see I have manage node one manage node 2 connected with my laptop perfect let me create a new folder let's call this folder as now I'm writing a new playbook all together to show you the error handling concept so I'll just call this as error handling perfect in this I will create a file let me call this as main.yaml need to have a inventory file let's call this as inventory.in and within the inventory. ini because these are UBuntu to host I'll say ubuntu@ because the passwordless authentication is set up with the uban 2 so I'll just provide the IP addresses perfect the inventory part is done now let's go to the main.yaml![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29fd4018-1fe4-4bfa-92d1-9cd17b574682)
If u want to ignore the gather facts![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09d8bb48-84be-4a7d-a148-aa65e178cdff)
make sure the packages open SSH and open SSL are up to date I have to use an anible buil-in apt generally if you have one package you will directly Define that package open SSH and you will say State as latest but here I am given with two packages open SSH and open SSL it is better to write a loop and within the loop you can just Define open SSH open SSL and just replace the name  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a289b097-64af-4ebc-96cb-00453e916d14)

Step no-2 verify if Docker is installed(((![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b36315f-cf6c-455d-858f-529d789668a0)  ))))

we are granted with the permission to ignore this error and how do you do that is simply add ignore errors yes  FYI ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e5690ab-63ed-4481-bbc5-98e377e552de)

check if Docker is installed if it does not exist on the manage nodes then install Docker 
here we have to use the when condition and on the when condition we need to see if this particular step okay if this particular step is throwing error that is when the previous step is a failure Docker hyphen hyen version command only if this fails when this fails then install Docker this is the requirement that is  given to us and in the anible world this is the pseudo code install Docker using the APT command when the previous step was a failure that is Docker hyphen hyphen version----------how do you do that?-----in ansible what you can do is whenever you run a command you can store the output of this command using a keyword called register so you can simply say register and provide a variable name so I'm going to provide a simple variable name where I'll call it as output (((   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edc32172-2b94-4d43-ad9d-aa3dbc8bf487)  ))) 

whenever you want to print a variable in anible you can simply use anible built-in debug and say bar followed by the variable name it will print and debug (((  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1d252a3-f841-433f-8ef5-9c2578168090)  ))) 
when output dot what is this output dot failed only when output do fail is true so so only when output. field you can also say output. field is equals to is equals to true or output. field so when this condition is met when the output is failed then install the docker so why the output has failed where are we getting this variable from we are using the register in the register we are storing the output of Docker hyphen hyphen version using the DEA command I understood what is stored
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ac0f369-14eb-4206-b864-232d7656b06d)

you might have these kind of requirements from your client or the project team so you will use ignore errors to handle the errors...
---------------defining the failures--------------
let me go to a ec2 instance let me use LS command on a non-existing file or a folder I will do LS abishek(name)or whatever u want he list so the error says cannot access abishek no such file or directory if I do LS on the root directory it will say cannot open directory because permission is denied so the ls command is the same here also I'm running the ls command on a folder or a file here also I'm running the ls command but on a different folder or a file the error is different here the error says no such file or directory here the error says permission denied in anible if you want to ignore a particular type of error okay both of these are errors because of the ls command but if you want to ignore a particular type of error you can use this syntax called failed when 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43f4a884-31df-4516-9ae7-c48cedc5693b)

you will register for the ls command you will simply register a variable to record the output of the ls command the output of this LS command is registered in this result variable and in the result variable which is a Json object so you will look out for a particular thing called as result.stdout you can say when the error is no such file or directory or just provide no such if you find anything like that in result.sdout you can ignore the failure and move to the next task so this is a special case of error handling if you are using ignore error as yes then all the errors will will be ignored if you want to handle only one particular type of error for this if you're using ignore error as yes it will ignore both of these errors for the no such file out directory as well as permission denied but if you're using failed when then you can ignore either this one or this one by registering the output and on the output verifying using the particular string that matches the std.out so this is another way of handling errors in ansible ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30ba68f8-8208-4461-a14c-d716dddd9ed6)




Day 9: Ansible Vault for Security

- Understanding Ansible Vault and its role in securing sensitive data.
- Encrypting and decrypting files using Ansible Vault.
- Best practices for managing secrets and sensitive data in Ansible.
  
when I write an anable Playbook why should I uh secure the contents in my anable playbook
assume you are a devops engineer and you are writing anable Playbook let's say the anable Playbook that you are writing is to create a ec2 instance  First install the AWS collection then you need to install the dependencies such as boto 3 to interact with the AWS apis writing the anible Playbook within your anible playbook you have to provide your AWS access key as well as AWS secret key you have also provided this in your anable playbook and when you executed this on your local machine it works fine Now if u want to share this Playbook with other people in your organization because others also want to use a similar Playbook so you want to share them let's assume through a git repository or through anable Galaxy but for easy understanding let's say you want to upload this through the git repository and share it with others in your organization now when you upload this to git if you have any sort of sensitive information then the sensitive information becomes public here in this case it's quite obvious uh AWS access key and secret key as an example but sometimes you might have uh sensitive information within the variables you might have sensitive information within your files so if you upload that to git so you have compromised with your sensitive information so this is why you need to secure and how do you secure right this is the most important thing okay as a devops engineer in whether it's genkins whether it's terraform whether it's kubernetes you know you secure the resources but in anible how do you do that anible provides a very simple and straightforward solution for Walt you don't need to install anything new you can directly use the command called anible Vault((( ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3eef5eb-8277-4852-8081-1448759eb97e)   )))
 it comes out of the box when you install anible on your machine you can use the anible Vault command no additional installation is required for example I have anible installed on this machine now if I just run anible hyphen VA you can see the command is available and I can use that but again the question is how does this anible wall command works and how it secures the files for you it uses the same logic just like like a regular bank vault for example you have some physical assets like documents or u have money that you want to save so you go to a bank and you use the Vault service in the bank or a locker service in the bank you provide the initial password because to use the Vault first you need to set a password so you provide an initial password then the Vault opens for you you put all that sensitive information in it like the documents files money whatever it is and then again you log The Vault using the same password next time when you want to access the Vault let's say to add new files to it new documents to it or to remove some of the things from it what you will do is again you will provide the password only if you provide the right password you will be able to access it that's how Walt secures the assets for you now anible also use the same logic where if you want to secure a file now what do I mean by secure a file basically let's say if you want to encrypt a file or you want to encrypt a variable 
 let's take file which has all your passwords  ----for example---if you want to secure encrypt this file you go to the Vault service in anible the anible VA command and you provide a initial password for it only if you provide the password anible Vault will be able to encrypt the files for you of course the password can be of your choice it can be a simple one it can be a strong password and now Walt returns you an encrypted file again the logic is same if you want to add contents to this file let's say you want to add a new password or let's say you want to remove one of the password or you want to update an existing password so you need to provide the Vault password to perform any action such as encrypt decrypt edit delete anything that you want to do so the same logic right just like your bank W and Vault also works the same way  
 let's see how to encrypt that so first of all I will put the file in a place where all of my hosts can use that file so I will upload that file to group vars folder ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3120ba5-401c-4a9e-a264-f72fe371949c)
 in group vars if you upload something some variables to all folder that means all your host can access it so CD all((((![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9f9f95d-6e17-4588-a469-cc2cf02bee12)  )))
 and now let's create a new file let me remove the existing one 
 now if I create a file for example ignore we don't have valaut if I create something called credentials.yaml(( ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44b0bcaf-f6b1-43d2-9ab6-25c7fefb0219)  ))
add access and secret key   why do you need this access key and secret key obviously if anable wants to talk to the AWS it talks through the API we are using the boto3 module and in any of the case you need to provide your access key and the secret key only then the authentication and authorization will be done if I just save the file like this and if I upload this to a git repository  then the AWS credentials are compromised
--instead of doing this what we are going to do is we will say anible vault create let's provide the location of the file anible Vault created ((( ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a8695f3-ab7c-4c4e-bbf0-3bea305c577b)  ))

can I also pass this password from the command line  other option is that you can also pass it using anible valaut Create AWS credentials. yaml 

where I haven't uploaded any credentials yet AWS credentials. yaml and I can say hyphen hyen Walt password file and the location of the file I already have a password file with name wall. pass (((( ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f935a418-85cd-41a1-9efb-82ecf0f03bd4) )))
and now it opened the Vault for me so it opened a file for me anible Vault opened a file for me now I can simply say ec2 uncore access key let's say I provide some dummy value ec2 underscore secret key and again I will provide a dummy value save the file using the WQ command  ---let's try to cat the file if you cat the aws_credentials. yaml you will see the encrypted content ((( ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9346556e-0a77-4f36-a8b8-4348df4f279c)
  )))that means without the password without this particular password nobody will know what is the decrypted content of this file nobody will know what is your e to access key and what is your e to secret key so again how to decrypt you can use the anible VA command anible ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e095a19-2b87-416d-a638-9b5d868cb611) 
see decryption is successful now let's CAD the file see I can see the content I can also perform the edit action okay if you try to encrypt this one more time let's do it anible Walt create awor credentials. yaml I need to encrypt it that's why I'm using the create command(((  and this time let's create a password file here itself so that you know people who don't know how to create a password file one is you can directly use the password from the command line itself but what I would recommend is use at least some strong password so in the previous class I have explained how you can create a random password which is strong enough so you can use the op SSL random command and you can generate a random uh string and you can put that as a password it's an encoded password which comes with at least some security

how to edit the sensitive information which is already in the vault 
first let's encrypt the existing a AWS credentials file anible Vault create AWS credentials.yaml ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96da9d07-6999-47c7-9038-fa45f2e47780)
If he already had a file its is not encrypted but you already have the file for that u need to delete that file.

I want to add one more password along with my AWS access key secret key let's say I want to add some API token ? 
exactly the same command but just replace the create with edit(![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a88c5f4d-d91d-43e3-ba53-8bef625e7521)))
 edit and you will have access to the Vault now you can just say API uncore token and add a new password to even the new one that you have added if you try to open the credentials you will not be able to see that everything will be encrypted just you have edited the content that is already in the world so it will still remain the secure perfect 
If u want to see only the content like view command ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15b221d7-f999-4b76-9acb-3b5192d0b4a7)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb1cccd7-740b-456b-a1b2-2882a6c22b15)

what is the encrypt command?
et's say I have is you have joined a project where within the project they already have this file called access key and they have updated the content to it now you cannot use anible Walt create Command right because the file is already here if you use create it will ask you to provide a new file in such cases you can simply run the command anible vaal encrypt because the file is already there encrypt AWS credentials(![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10c4f2a9-7990-4883-92db-b38333ed4688)  ))   abc. yaml and definitely it will ask you for the password it works the same way but in the create command you are creating the file if you're using the encrypt you are encrypting the existing file that's the only thing so anible Vault.

encrypt string?
ou have an existing variable in your anable playbook you don't want to encrypt the entire file you just want to encrypt a particular string so you can use this command anible VA encrypt string Foobar ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a73864f9-e4bb-4d9e-b40f-26025b3f61be)  got the encrypted value of Fubar same logic who can decrypt it Whoever has this vault.pass they can decrypt.

 most important one is your password just like if you have a vault in your Bank okay and you have all the important information in your bank W you have a lot of money you have documents and you shared that password with someone else what happens all the information hat you have in your bank will be used by someone else so you know there is no point of using a vault itself in the same way even in anible Vault the most important thing is password  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed9a46c2-3d0a-4cfc-bd7f-e0e34e2cbd51)
secret Management Solutions so that you don't compromise with your password 
 best practice use a strong password  second is you can store these things like here the wall. pass I have on my machine so I'm using it but you cannot share this file with everyone this is on your local machine so what you need to do is you need to upload this password files to secret Management Services like AWS systems parameter store or AWS Secrets manager if you in the AWS ecosystem if you're in Azure you can use the Azure VA service or any equivalent service basically store the vault.pass file or the file which has your Vault password in secret Management Solutions  if you just put that wall. pass in any random machine which everyone has access to you just upload it to virtual machine and developers also has access to that virtual machine then there is no point of using the anible Vault itself so this is some recommendations where how to use strong passwords and how to secure it another important thing about passwords for examle if i have 10 anable playbooks and 10 anable roles should I use the same password should I use the same password for all of my anible playbooks if you use the same password for all the anable playbooks if x person comes to know about this password then the X person can manipulate with all the 10 anible playbooks or if you're using one password for anable Playbook that is if you have 10 anible playbooks if you are using 10 different passwords tomorrow you might have 100 anible playbooks then this might become thousand anable playbooks I'm just giving an example so it is again not good to have unique password for each anable Playbook at the same time it is also not good to have one common password so the recommendation is that what you can do within your organization you will definitely have different environments like UT which is development environment you will have a staging you will have uh production so in the interviews or while you are preparing this wall setup in your organization you can follow a practice where for the dev envirment you can have one anible VA password for the staging envirment you can have a different one and for the production one you can have a different one usually production very less people will have access to it so in the AWS Secrets manager you can store your anible uh prod related ones password related to your anible prod servers and using IM you can restrict access only to few people that's how you can secure the password of anible Walt even if your Dev envirment one  because Dev envirment you might Grant access to everyone you might say that this is my vault password even if it gets compromised you can still protect your prod servers using anible if you configuring your prod servers you can still secure the password of your anable Vault so these are some of the best practices related to anable VA password and the assignment is that you can go back and practice the ec2 instance creation or any AWS resource creation the logic will be the same you can go to the day six folder or even the day7 folder I have   the prerequisites how to set up connection with AWS first thing install the boto3 module it's a prerequisite then install the AWS collection generate a VA password and then you can start creating encrypted files where you have save your AWS credentials this is a sample anable Playbook which is used for creating AWS E2 instance and the secure information that you have created I am passing it using the ginger to templating style so try this so that you are confident about the anible Vault ...

 how to create a Vault password

 
Day 10: Policy as Code
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d83b1eee-6d0c-4309-9f32-7aefc5edcb1c)
let's say you are in your school University or at the office any of these places they have policy in place that is to enter your school University or your office you need to wear identity card now that is nothing but a policy that your organization has or a rule that your organization has for the purpose of security similarly in the world of it in the world of software development life cycle policies are put in place to make sure your organization is secure and the in infrastructure resources users in your organizations are subjected to compliance can we take an example to understand for sure let's say you have a AWS account within the AWS account you might have multiple S3 buckets now as a devops engineer using infrastructure as code you might have created these S3 buckets after a while of creation of this S3 buckets there is a policy that is introduced in your organization a compliance that is introduced in your organization that every S3 bucket in your organization should have versioning enabled now some of the S3 buckets might be created by devops Engineers using infrastructure as code some might be created by developers some might be created for test Engineers to store their artifacts a policy is introduced which says any of such S3 buckets doesn't matter who has created versioning has to be enabled or public the S3 bucket should not be public or there might be any policies introduced in your organization also something like every e to instance must have an instance profile attached with a specific policy or every IM user must have access to a particular resource so these are different kinds of policies that can be introduced in your organizations either for the purpose of security or for the purpose of compliance now the question is why are they very important okay we understood what exactly is a policy and in terms of software development life cycle what are these policies now if you talk about why why are they very important now whenever we talk about security or we talk about compliance by default these are very important for your organization let's say in your organization developers have permissions to create S3 bucket and one of the developer creates S3 bucket stores very important information in the S3 bucket it can be the application logs or it can be any artifacts and keeps this S3 bucket public so this is a point of concern because the developer has put an S3 bucket public which has important information of your organization which is compromising security so for such reasons every organization will have policies and it is important to implement these policies now the problem is that to implement these policies like if there is only one S3 bucket in the example that we have taken or if you're talking about IM users or if you're talking about easy to instance profile if there is only one E2 instance or one IM user or one S3 bucket it's very Implement to easy to implement these policies update these policies or if required to remove these policies but quite obviously in an organization you will have hundreds of S3 buckets hundreds of ec2 instances and hundreds of IM users so how would you make sure a polic that is implemented is applied to all the resources so for that there is a concept called policy as code 
we do is programmatically as a devops engineer or as a Dev secops engineer we programmatically update the policies so that it reflects to all the resources that is Target for the policy as code implementation 
you want to apply a specific policy to all the S3 buckets as a devop seems there either we can use programming languages like python if you're talking about AWS you all know 
here is a python module called boto3 so you can write a Python program which will update all the S3 buckets with the required policy or you can also use yaml files if your organization is not very or your devop team is not very well versed with python so you can also use something like yaml and use tools like Ansible.
how to implement policy as code using an anible---

as a devops engineer you will write a anible playbook in this case passwordless authentication is not a prerequisite for anable I have explained this in the previous classes as well only if you're anible playable is talking to the virtual machines or the servers you need to set up passwordless authentication with that but when anible is talking to AWS or network appliances or any resources other than the servers then you don't need to implement passwordless authentication because the anible Playbook that you are writing it will talk to the API of AWS in specific case the S3 API and Implement things on the S3 API if at all your anible playbook was talking to a virtual machine or a server what it would do the anible Playbook that you are writing it will SSH to your ec2 instance install the module that you are writing in the Playbook and execute that module on the ec2 instance that's why pass less authentication is required in the later case going back to our policy as code concept so we will write anable Playbook now which will talk to the API of S3 and it will implement the things so the prerequisite here another prerequisite is to install boto3 why you have provided anable Playbook with your AWS credentials the that is fine but to make an API call with that credentials Ansible will use a python module called boto3 so first you need to have python installed on that machine along with that you also need to have boto3 installed again 

 let's create the Playbook file let me call it as S3_versioning.yaml we should always start with three hyphens and let's provide name for this Playbook enforce S3 bucket versioning on AWS of course S3 is on AWS![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/126c51a9-3542-4ef9-91dc-66d50f34936e)

we have registered a variable that is result so we are storing the output of bucket info into a variable called result the output of result is this entire thing but what I want to get end of the day is the buckets buckets is an array and within that array you have item one item two and item three element one element two and element three so this particular code that you are writing will Loop over three items and it will get executed three times but as per the S3 bucket syntax it will need the exact name of your bucket to enable versioning on that particular bucket how can you get the name in this particular array when you Loop over each element so you will get Buckets do0 something like that so it is  buckets. name so that you can retrieve the exact name of the bucket that's why I have item. name if I want creation date it will be item do creation date perfect so now let's run this code before that let me show you one more time that the buckets versioning is disabled Mega metric gum X bucket versioning is disabled now if I simply execute this okay uh there is some error let's try to fix it Local Host item valid booleans include zero y1 on false what is it exactly trying to do okay versioning is of type false uh okay so what does it say is when I set this value versioning as enabled it says that the value for the versioning can be only of yes or F or true or t so let me just say versioning as yes let me try one more time okay it is executing enable versioning it has changed Mega metric Gillum now it will try to change middleware then it will also try to change the payment app logs you can see ok3 changed one so let's try to see if the mega metric Gillum bucket the bucket versing is enabled or not okay bucket versioning is enabled then let's go to another bucket as well middleware bucket let's see the properties enabled finally let's go to our last bucket so that we can verify Anil has updated all of your S3 buckets with respect to the required policy of your organization perfect so this is how you implement policy as code of course you can do it with python you can do it with terraform you can do it with lot of other tools but personally I would prefer anible for this task
